							<h1>Product Design</h1>
							<p>The Product Design project I undertook during my second year of university was very valuable and taught me many skills in the concept generation field. For this project I was part of a group of 4 and we were tasked with creating a product that assisted the elderly while using public transport.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pd/pd5.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This required us to explore the many issues public transport users face, especially those older users. By doing this we were able to develop a problem statement relating to elderly users' experience on a bus.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pd/pd1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                            <p>After creating a problem statement we split off to create a range of ideas that we then  ranked and decided upon a route the design should follow.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pd/pd2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                            <p>The design passed through a series of iterations before ending up at the final design shown in the poster below. I was tasked with the design of this poster and it taught me a lot about presenting a design and what it is important to show at the forefront of the view</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pd/pd3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                            <p>As with all designs it is important to consider material and environmental costs when finalising a concept. We performed life cycle assessments on the embodied carbon and embodied energy to identify the concepts downfalls and came up with a list of potential improvements that could be made to the product if more time were to be allocated to the project.</p>
